## Project 4

Program that implements a queue-based simulation of a bank operating with only 1 teller
Data is read from a text file through command-line parameter parsing.
The program outputs a trace of the arrival and departure events executed (one line per event) and summary statistics, which include the number of customers serviced and the average time spent waiting in line. The program will also check if there is a service anomaly and print an error message is such an anomaly is detected.

###### The data files are data-0, data-1, and data-2
