## Project 4

Program that implements a queue-based simulation of a bank with only 1 teller.
Data is read from a text file through command-line parameter parsing.
The program outputs a trace of the arrival and departure events executed (one line per event) and summary statistics, which include the number of customers serviced and the average time spent waiting in line
